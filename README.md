# VHSStop
This programm checks a part of the screen (OBS recoding preview) for two colors. If a percentage of the area displays either of these colors for 3 seconds a keyboard shortcut will be used in order to stop the OBS recording, makes a "beeping"-sound and sends a Discord notification to a server via a Webhook. Additionally there is a tolerance on how close the color has to be to the specified color.

# Configuration
## Checked Area
The checked area has to be configured as it changes with different screens. To do so you need to specify the pixels on where your OBS recording preview is and how big it is.

## Colors
## Tolerance
## Discord integration
In order to send Discord notifications upon completion a Discord Webhook link is required.
